# Issues


* the *outside* algorithm has never been tested, whereas the general algorithm is simple and might be correct, the datastructures have changed

* many related algorithms do not have a similar interface (e.g. viterbi, kbest)

* sliced Nederhof is not taking into account weights from the automaton (very simple change)

# Missing

* Sliced Earley

* organise parsing code within a module called `parsing`
