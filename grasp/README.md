# Missing

This is a list of things to do.
Most packages have a `README` file of their own, those might also contain a list of possible improvements.

* reversed value recursion (with approximate supremum)
* unit tests
* synchronous parsing
* support to TSG and TAG
* Simulated annealing 
* configuration file

* optional max span for parser (relevant for MT)
* ngram order features in KenLM/StatelessLM
* accept rules without features (change parser)
