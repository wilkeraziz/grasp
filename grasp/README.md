This is a list of things to do.
Most packages have a `README` file of their own, those might also contain a list of possible improvements.

* reversed value recursion (with approximate supremum)
* unit tests
* migrate core code to Cython
* synchronous parsing
* support to TSG and TAG
* Simulated annealing 
* configuration file
